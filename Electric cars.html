       <p>Instead of a fuel tank, an electric vehicle has an on-board battery that gets charged through an electricity supply and then stores and uses that energy to power an electric motor and set the wheels in motion. It means the cars have no need for a clutch and gearbox or an exhaust pipe and it makes them much quieter and, many say, smoother to drive.
